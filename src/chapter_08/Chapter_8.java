/**
 * Created by Syed Wajahat on 1/3/2020.
 * Chapter 8 is about input and out.
 * File system, java.io API and Streams
 * java.io.File class is used to read information about files and
 * directories in a file system. Create/Delete files and directories, and
 * list the contents to the directories.
 * We cannot use File class to access the contents of a file. We need other classes
 * for that which are streams in the java.io package.
