/**
 * Created by Syed Wajahat on 1/4/2020.
 * Stream is an indefinite wave (waves) of data like water
 * Each byte or block is considered as a single wave
 * We read either byte or character or string of characters
 * Sometimes we read chunks or groups of bytes or characters
 * The classes with Buffered with them are the one which read
 * data in groups.
 * Three built-in JAVA streams:
 * System.in
 * System.err
 * System.out
