    This section is about design principles

    Encapsulation ensures maintainability of invariants
    invariant is like a property of truth which is retained even
    if the data is changed

    Rules of encapsulation - it is a design pattern
    A design pattern defines a set of rules to be followed
    when creating objects in memory.

    In encapsulation, we provide private access modifier to all instance variables
    of the class and create public getter and setters and constructors
    Encapsulation helps use implement the invariants' protection
