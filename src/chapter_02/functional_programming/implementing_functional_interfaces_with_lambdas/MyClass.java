    Lambda expression is like a block of code that gets passed around like an anonymous method
    Lambda expression relies on notion of deferred execution.

    Understand the lambda expression
    a -> a.canHop()
    is equal to this: (Animal a) -> { return a.canHop(); }

    return and ; and mandatory with {} used with body and vice-versa
    we can avoid return if the method return type is void
    The () in the input parameters can be omitted if there is exactly one parameter
    and the type of input parameter is not defined

    If there are multiple input parameters, data type of all should be defined or none.
