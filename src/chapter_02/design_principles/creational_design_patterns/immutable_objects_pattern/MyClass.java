    5 Golden rules of Immutable Objects Pattern
    1. Make all fields private and final
    2. Set all instance variables of the class through the constructor
    3. Do not provide any setter methods for variables
    4. Prevent methods from being overridden. Make the class final
    5. Don't provide access to reference fields (Objects) to modified or accessed directly
